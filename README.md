1. Set up Dependabot version updates
    Add `.github/dependabot.yml`

    Use the following as a base, and add entries for any languages used in this repository:

    ```yaml
    # .github/dependabot.yml
    version: 2
    updates:
      # Automatically update GitHub Actions
      - package-ecosystem: github-actions
        directory: /
        schedule:
          interval: weekly
    ```

1. Pin Action versions to commit SHAs
    Replace `uses:` tag references with pinned commit SHAs in all workflows:

    ```yaml
    # NG (tag reference)
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # OK (pinned to commit SHA)
    - uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2
